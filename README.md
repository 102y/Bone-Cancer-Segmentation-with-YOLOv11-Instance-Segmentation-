# Bone-Cancer-Segmentation-with-YOLOv11-Instance-Segmentation-
This project aims to utilize the YOLOv11 model for Instance Segmentation to detect bone cancer in medical images. The model is trained using the Bone Cancer Segmentation dataset available on the Roboflow platform, which contains annotated images for training the model to accurately identify affected regions.
Project Objectives:
Bone Cancer Detection: The model identifies bone cancer in radiology or medical images by segmenting the image into regions containing cancer, aiding in medical diagnosis.
YOLOv11 Segmentation: The model utilizes YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art architecture in machine learning for computer vision, combining fast performance with high accuracy in object localization and precise segmentation.
Instance Segmentation: The model detects each bone cancer instance independently and delineates its exact location and shape in the image.
Project Details:
Model Used: The project leverages the YOLOv11 model adapted for Instance Segmentation, enabling the identification of each individual cancer lesion with pixel-level precision.
Dataset: The model is trained on the Bone Cancer Segmentation dataset, which provides annotated images with detailed information on the locations of cancer lesions in radiology images. This dataset can be accessed from Roboflow's Bone Cancer Segmentation dataset.
Training and Customization: The model is customized to detect bone cancer using the data.yaml configuration file, which defines training parameters such as the number of classes and image sizes.
How to Use:
1 Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
2 Install Requirements: Install the required libraries and dependencies using:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
3 Train the Model: Train the model using the data.yaml file, which contains dataset configurations:
python
نسخ الكود
model.train(data="path_to_data.yaml", epochs=10, imgsz=640, device="cpu")
4 Use the Trained Model: After training, use the model to make predictions on new images (e.g., radiology or medical images):
python
نسخ الكود
results = model("path_to_image", save=True)
results[0].show()
Expected Outputs:
The trained model will be saved at the specified path runs/segment/train/weights/best.pt.
The trained model can be used to make predictions on new images and visualize the results.
Potential Applications:
Medical Diagnosis: This model can assist in diagnosing bone cancer accurately by providing clear visualizations of affected areas.
Medical Imaging: The project represents a step toward leveraging AI for faster and more accurate analysis of radiological and medical images.
