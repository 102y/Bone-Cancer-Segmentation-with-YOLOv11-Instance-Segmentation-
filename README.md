# Bone-Cancer-Segmentation-with-YOLOv11-Instance-Segmentation-
This project aims to utilize the YOLOv11 model for Instance Segmentation to detect bone cancer in medical images. The model is trained using the Bone Cancer Segmentation dataset available on the Roboflow platform, which contains annotated images for training the model to accurately identify affected regions.
